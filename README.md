# Rivals-of-Aether-2-KO-Calculator
A calculator that takes information about an attack's statistics and returns when it will vertically knock out opposing characters on every stage at every platform height.

# How to run
You will need Apache maven installed. Once you do, go into the 'rivals2' directory in command line. Enter 'mvn clean compile exec:java', at which point you will be prompted on information for the calculation - whether to calculate for all stages, the statistics of the attack, and the stage height if you choose not to calculate for every stage. The program will then return the information for knocking out each character off the top based on that one height, or on every single stage and height.
